### My Story

I started my academic journey at Shandong University, where I earned my Bachelor of Software Engineering. My curiosity and dedication led me to pursue a Master of Computing at Australian National University, where I have maintained an impressive GPA of 6.5/7.0.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with leading tech companies like Baidu and Sina.com, where I honed my skills in software development and testing. My experiences range from developing advertising delivery engines to conducting multi-modal interaction tests for speech recognition software.

Most recently, as an AI Research Intern at the Research Graph Foundation, I built a structured network graph and developed an interactive dashboard to visualize academic data, showcasing my ability to contribute to meaningful projects in the field of artificial intelligence.

### My Hobbies

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me indulging in my favorite pastimes:

- **Reading**: From technical papers to science fiction novels, I love getting lost in a good book.
